    <string name="intro">Leaf recognizer is created in an effort to bring expert knowledge on plants to the hands of an user. Our dataset on Indian plants grows every day. You can click the camera icon on top to take a picture leaf of any plant you want to identify.</string>

    <string name="noconnection_text">Sorry, We are having trouble contacting our server</string>
    <string name="nomatches_text">Sorry, We were unable to find any matches with the query</string>


    <string name="intro_inst1">Using our Leaf recognizer, you can identify over a hundred plants in your surroundings. To recognise a plant using our app, all you need is a decent picture of it. Please read through to know more about the functioning of the app.</string>
    <string name="intro_inst2">In online mode, any picture taken will be sent to a hosted server and the received results will be displayed using the app. All the computations will be done on a remote server. You will need active internet connection when using this mode.</string>
    <!--<string name="intro_inst2">In online mode</string>-->


    <string name="intro_inst3">This switch can be toggled for offline mode. In offline mode, any picture taken will be processed on the mobile itself and the results will be displayed using the app. All the computations will be done using mobile hardware. You will not need any active internet connection when using this mode.</string>
    <string name="intro_inst4">Using this icon, you can access camera application on your mobile. The picture clicked by camera by this process is used by Leaf recognizer for further processing.</string>
    <string name="intro_inst5">Using this icon, you can access the picture gallery on your mobile. The picture selected from the gallery/files by this process is used by Leaf recognizer for further processing.</string>
    <string name="intro_inst6">After query image is acquired, it will be displayed in the app. If the leaf/plant occupy very little part of the picture, you can select the relevant part by drawing a rectangle here.</string>
    <string name="intro_inst7">After the relevant part of the image is selected, you can send it for identification by clicking this button.</string>
    <string name="intro_inst8">If you are interested in getting to know about different plant species, you can browse them in our website. This button will take you there. You can even contribute to the portal by editing/adding any existing/new information to our portal. To edit/add data, you need to signup. Your account will be approved in two days on an average.</string>
